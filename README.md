# Ski map thing

When Jasper and I were skiing in Saalbach-Hinterglemm, we noticed we had some
trouble finding the way to the correct lift. After a day of skiing, Jasper came
to me and suggested this idea of a routing app that would show which slopes and
lifts should be taken in order to arrive at a certain destination.

Let this README be the first commit to the result of that idea.
